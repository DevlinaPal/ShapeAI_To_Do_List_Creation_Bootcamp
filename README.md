SHAPEAI Fundamentals of Javascript and DOM BOOTCAMP
<br><br>
![](Images/%20photo.jpg)
<br><br><br>Hi I made this project during the 7 Days Free Bootcamp, conducted by <b> SHAPEAI
</b>.
The instructor during the session was Mr. Kartik Gupta (Ex-intern @ENTHU.AI & Google Summer of Code). I got to
learn a lot during these 7 days and it was an amazing experience learning with SHAPEAI.
<br>I got to have hands on experience on:
<li>JavaScript
<li>HTML
<li>CSS
<br>during these 7 days, and everything was explained from the very basics so that
anyone with zero experience on programming can learn.
I enjoyed these 7 days, you can as well. To register for next free 7 days bootcamp, visit:
